# Time Tracking Dashboard

This is a solution to the [Time tracking dashboard challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw).

## Overview

A user-friendly time-tracking dashboard that displays time spent on various activities. The dashboard provides insights into daily, weekly, and monthly usage, helping users analyze how their time is allocated.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behaviour

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".

## My process

### Built with

Using the Mobile-first workflow, this project was built using HTML for structuring the dashboard, SASS preprocessor for a visually appealing and responsive design and JavaScript for functionality to manage and display time-tracking data dynamically.
